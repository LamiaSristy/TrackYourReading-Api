# TrackYourReading--Api

The objective of this project was to create a mobile App, which can track any specific things and presented with a list of things to be measured. This is the Back-End part, where I have created api and endpoints. For the Front_End I have used React.

**The Back End API**

The back-end for this project consists of a REST API that manages the tracking database. This database is integrated by the following 3 tables:

1. User Table: For storing username, and encrypted password and password confirmation.

2. Book Table: For storing the name of the Book, its author, genre, and number of pages. The User will create it.

3. Tracking Table: For storing the date and how many pages has been read by user, on that particular date.
